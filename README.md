Image steganography is a technique of hiding secret information, such as text, images, or audio, within a cover image in a way that the very existence of the hidden data is not detectable. The process involves using a normal image as a cover, converting the secret data into a binary format, and then embedding it into the cover image using a steganographic algorithm. The resulting image, known as the stego image, contains the hidden secret data. There are three main types of image steganography: spatial domain, which hides data in the pixel values of the cover image; frequency domain, which hides data in the frequency coefficients of the cover image; and transform domain, which hides data in the transform coefficients of the cover image, such as DCT or DWT. The advantages of image steganography include its ability to provide a secure way to transmit secret data, as well as its invisibility, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to detect the hidden information.
